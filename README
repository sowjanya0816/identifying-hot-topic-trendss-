# Identifying Hot Topic Trends in Streaming Text Data

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting hot topic trends in streaming text data using a sequential evolution model based on distributed representations. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze and visualize emerging topics in real-time. The system processes large-scale streaming data from sources like social media, news platforms, and online forums.

## Features
- Real-time trend detection from streaming text data
- Sentiment analysis to understand public opinion
- Scalable processing using distributed frameworks
- Visual representation of detected trends using graphs and dashboards
- Implementation of various ML algorithms including Decision Trees, Na√Øve Bayes, and SVM

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: Django (for web-based interaction)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Word2Vec
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, NLTK
- **Storage**: MySQL (WAMP Server)
- **Distributed Processing**: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Django Framework
- MySQL Database (or any preferred database management system)
- Apache Kafka & Apache Spark (for distributed processing)

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sowjanya0816/hot-topic-trends.git
   cd hot-topic-trends
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the database:
   - Configure `settings.py` with database credentials
   - Run migrations:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```
4. Start the Django server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
5. (Optional) Start Apache Kafka and Spark if using distributed processing.

## Usage
- **Admin Panel**: Log in as an admin to view user activity and system logs.
- **User Dashboard**: Registered users can submit text data for trend detection.
- **Trend Analysis**: Real-time visualization of emerging topics.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Streams text data from social media and news APIs.
2. **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
3. **Topic Modeling**: Implements LDA, Word2Vec, and Sequential Evolution Model.
4. **Trend Detection**: Identifies emerging topics and their evolution over time.
5. **Visualization**: Presents trends using dashboards and charts.

## Results
- Achieved **high accuracy** in detecting relevant trends.
- Implemented a **scalable** architecture for handling large-scale streaming data.
- Developed **interactive visualizations** for intuitive trend analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with more social media platforms.
- Improved topic modeling using deep learning (e.g., BERT, GPT models).
- Support for multilingual trend detection.
- Advanced real-time sentiment analysis.
